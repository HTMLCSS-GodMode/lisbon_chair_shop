# Lisbon Chair Shop

## Overview

**Lisbon Chair Shop** is a clean, minimalistic web app that showcases a variety of high-quality chairs available for purchase. Built using **pure HTML and CSS**, this project emphasizes user-friendly design principles while adhering to modern web design standards. The goal is to provide an intuitive, aesthetically pleasing shopping experience that highlights the craftsmanship and style of the chairs available.

## Web Design Principles

### 1\. **Typography: Inter**

The **Inter** font is used throughout the project to ensure readability and modern appeal:

- **Inter** is a popular sans-serif typeface known for its clean and professional appearance, making it ideal for web projects.
- The font supports clear hierarchy, with bold styles for headers and lighter weights for body text to improve legibility.
- The consistent use of Inter helps unify the aesthetic while providing a readable, user-friendly interface.

### 2\. **Color Palette**

Colors are carefully chosen to represent a sense of elegance and trustworthiness:

- A **neutral color scheme**---soft whites, muted greys, and warm beiges---is used for the background to ensure that the chairs are the main focal point.
- **Accent colors**, such as deep brown or muted green, are applied to key interactive elements (buttons, hover effects, and links) to add contrast and draw attention.
- Ensuring high **contrast** between text and background aids in readability and accessibility.

### 3\. **Icons and Imagery**

- **Icons** are minimal and clear, primarily used for navigation, cart, and social links, contributing to the simplicity of the design.
- **Product images** are the centerpiece of each page. Each chair is showcased with high-quality, detailed photos to allow users to visualize the craftsmanship and style.
- Icons are utilized for actions like adding items to the cart or navigating the site, ensuring a smooth experience without excessive text.

### 4\. **Responsiveness**

The Lisbon Chair Shop is fully responsive, designed to work seamlessly across devices:

- A **mobile-first approach** ensures that users on smartphones and tablets have the same easy shopping experience as desktop users.
- The layout adjusts using **flexbox** and **grid** techniques, providing a fluid and dynamic user interface.
- **Media queries** are used to ensure all elements are well-proportioned, including navigation menus, product listings, and images.

### 5\. **Whitespace and Layout**

Whitespace is used extensively to give the design an airy, high-end feel:

- **Ample padding** between product images and descriptions ensures that each element has room to breathe, avoiding clutter and improving the overall user experience.
- **Grid-based layouts** are utilized to create a well-structured and visually pleasing layout for the products and content sections.

### 6\. **User Experience (UX)**

The website is designed with the user in mind:

- **Simple navigation** allows customers to easily explore different chair categories, read product details, and add items to their cart.
- The **checkout process** is designed to be as straightforward as possible, minimizing friction and improving conversion rates.
- **Hover effects** are subtle but clear, helping users understand interactive elements without overwhelming the experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic elements for content structure, ensuring accessibility and search engine optimization.
- **CSS3**: Used for styling, including layout with flexbox and grid, smooth transitions, and hover effects for enhanced interaction.

## Future Enhancements

- **JavaScript Integration**: Add dynamic functionalities such as cart management, filtering, and sorting of products.
- **Product Reviews**: Integrate user-generated reviews and ratings to enhance customer trust.
- **Payment Gateway Integration**: Enable secure online payments for a complete e-commerce experience.
- **Dark Mode**: Add a dark mode for better user comfort during nighttime browsing.
